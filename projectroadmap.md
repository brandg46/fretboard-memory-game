Completed sprint 1 for this project. Took a look at other repositories to see if I could use some of the code and get inspiration in setting up my own repository. 

Process of completing sprint 2. I downloaded pip and pygame in VSCODE terminal. Also, began coding for this project and frequently pushing commits from Github desktop to Github web.
